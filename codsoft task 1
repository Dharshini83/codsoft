        <p>On 25 April 2014, Mukund led a cordon and search operation in a village in South Kashmir, based on intelligence inputs regarding the presence of militants. During the operation, his team came under heavy fire. Mukund quickly responded, aware that the cover of darkness could allow the militants to escape. Since the number of civilians inside the house was unclear, the use of heavy-caliber weapons was not an option. Along with Sepoy Vikram Singh, Mukund crawled through the orchard in front of the house, avoiding gunfire. After successfully crossing the orchard, they entered the house, where they were met with intense firing, and Mukund was grazed by a bullet on his forearm. The two soldiers swiftly retaliated, killing one of the militants. Mukund identified that the militant commander they were searching for was not among the dead. The remaining two militants, including a senior commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, attempted to escape using grenade explosions. Mukund and Singh took cover to avoid injury. In the chaos, Mukund recognized the senior commander among the fleeing militants as they made their way to the nearby outhouse.</p>

        <p>Vikram Singh and his comrade approached the cement outhouse, believing that a grenade deployed moments earlier had neutralized the threat inside. However, as they stormed the structure, a sudden volley of gunfire hit Vikram. It became clear that while the grenade had indeed killed one individual, another remained. The commander, who had fled from the debris of a nearby residence, had not been alone. The second individual had been killed by the grenade, but the commander, Altaf Wani, survived.

            As the rounds of fire were exchanged, Wani, shielded by a row of logs inside the outhouse, continued to fire from his confined position. Vikram Singh, having taken two bullets—one to the neck and another to the jaw—collapsed. His comrade, Mukund, understood the severity of the wounds and realized that Vikram's life was at risk. Despite the gravity of the situation, there was no time for hesitation. Mukund immediately advanced, firing his AK-47 at Altaf Wani, fatally wounding him.</p>
